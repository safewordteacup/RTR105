1)
    The alphabetical and inverse_alphabetical functions are 
    simple if function trees that compare the different inputed
    chars. The program does accept any type of char(even " " and "\n"),
    because I couldn't make up my mind how t onarrow down the selection,
    without writing a exclusion if function that would check for every
    letter in the alphabet. yikers

        int clear;
        while(clear = getc(stdin)){
        if(clear == '\n') break;
        }
    This code simply creates an infinite loop that assigns the excess
    stdin input to the `clear` variable as to clear the stdin buffer
    and not have the next `scanf` line pick up input from the previous
    ones. It end when a line break is detected(The user would have 
    "entered" the variable).
    The getc() function gets the next character from a stream, then
    advances the postion indicator of the stream.

    The last piece of code simply let's the user select which of the
    two function to run.
